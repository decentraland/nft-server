 * the assets owned by an address, conventionally, the assets that were rented would not be returned because the owner is the rentals
 * contract.
 * This component will first fetch the rentals subgraph to check which assets are currently rented by a given address, and then look them up
 * in the marketplace subgraph to retrieve all the nft data.
 * @param options.rentalsComponent - The rentals component which allows querying the rentals subgraph.
 * @param options.marketplaceNFTsComponent - The marketplace component which allows querying the marketplace subgraph.
 * @param options.contractAddresses - The addresses of the Land and Estate contracts which will be used to filter the results.
